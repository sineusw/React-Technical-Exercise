# React-Technical-Exercise
Considerations:
A github repository must be made available from the first moment and sent to mariano@visionts.io . 
Make commits regularly and make any annotations and assumptions you consider necessary in the README file.
From the moment you receive the exercise you have 72 hours to complete it.

Exercise:
You need to deploy a performant React App that must have the following routes and that are only accessible if logged in (You have to make the log in too, it can be just a mock up that always validates that the login is correct):

	•	Lookup for an address and show it on a map, along with the current weather forecast for the next few days. (You can use any api you want from the internet).
	•	Change the username and details from the logged in user
	•	Launch an event that disables the first route (it will be no longer accessible once you access this route. The first route is the number one, the lookup screen)
	•	Log out the logged in user

Final notes:
Once you finish the test, please submit this test along with the final exercise in a .zip file to mariano@visionts.io. After that, we will schedule a final technical meeting with specific questions of React.
Good luck

Please let me know if you have any questions and don't forget to send me as soon as possible the GitHub repository.

If there's anything you can't reply/do, just leave it blank and when you send the final result to me, just let me know what you were not able to do, and how do you think you can improve it in the next months if hired.
